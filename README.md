# Surface speed to RPM graph

A simple graph to find the correct RPM based on workpiece (or tool) diameter and desired surface speed. The reposity contains the python file used, and the final PDF can be found in the releases.

## Using the graph

Using the graph is quite simple. Select your workpiece diameter on the left, follow the gridline until you meet the curved line for your desired surface speed, and follow the graph down to find the RPM.
